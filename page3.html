    <h1>Red Christmas</h1>
    <poem>
        On Christmas Day in London town,<br>
        A tale unfolded, dark and brown.<br>
        I, a stranger in a foreign place,<br>
        Fate dealt a card, an unexpected chase.<br><br>

        Face down, I met the cold, hard floor,<br>
        My front tooth shattered, dreams no more.<br>
        First day in London, a city grand,<br>
        But fate had other plans, not as planned.<br><br>

        To the hospital's room of urgency,<br>
        Rushed I was, in a state of emergency.<br>
        Bloodied tooth, a consciousness waning,<br>
        On Christmas Day, destiny was reigning.<br><br>

        Through the chaos, pain, and despair,<br>
        A dentist's touch, a tender care.<br>
        A brand-new tooth, a Christmas gift,<br>
        Amidst the turmoil, a spirits lift.<br><br>

        London, a city of memories and strife,<br>
        A chapter closed, a different life.<br>
        Yet, in the echoes of that fateful day,<br>
        I carry a tooth, a reminder to stay.<br><br>

        London may not suit, a truth so clear,<br>
        Yet, in its heart, a tale sincere.<br>
        On Christmas Day, a tooth reborn,<br>
        In London's grasp, a soul was torn.
